# Aim : Implement and analyze Merge sort  (Divide & Conquer)
  
# Theory : 

###1. Divide & Conquer Strategy

The Divide-And-Conquer paradigm uses the following strategy to solve problems.
• Break the problem into subproblems
• Solve the subproblems (recursively)
• Combine results of the subproblems

###2. Merge Sort Algorithm

#Conclusion : 
* Understood the concept of Divide and Conquer Strategy upon Merge Sort
* Was able to compute the Time Complexity of both the Sorting techniques based on Frequency Count Method
* Implemented and tested the complexity of the Merge Sort
