# Aim : Implement and analyze Merge sort  (Divide & Conquer)
  
# Theory : 
### 1. Divide & Conquer Strategy
The Divide-And-Conquer paradigm uses the following strategy to solve problems.
• Break the problem into subproblems
• Solve the subproblems (recursively)
• Combine results of the subproblems

### 2. Merge Sort Algorithm

# Program : 
// Attach the Program 
# Output :
// Attach the Output
# Conclusion : 
* Understood the concept of Divide and Conquer Strategy upon Merge Sort
* Was able to compute the Time Complexity of both the Sorting techniques based on Frequency Count Method
* Implemented and tested the complexity of the Merge Sort
