# Aim : Implement and analyze Longest common subsequence (Dynamic Programming)
  
# Theory : 
#### 1. Dynamic Programming
- Its a strategy used in algorithm design to solve optimization problems
- It breaks down the given problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.
- Key Concepts of Dynamic Programming
   1. **Optimal Substructure** : Deriving the solution to the overall problem from the solutions of its subproblems.
   2. **Overlapping Subproblems** : if the same smaller problems are solved multiple times.
   3. **Memoization (Top-Down Approach)** : Store the results of previously solved subproblems in a table (hashmap or array) to avoid recomputation.
   4. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)** : Solve smaller subproblems first and use their results to build up the solution to larger subproblems.
#### 2. Longest Common Subsequene (LCS) Problem
