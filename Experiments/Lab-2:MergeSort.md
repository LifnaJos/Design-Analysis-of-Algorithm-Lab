# Aim : Implement and analyze Merge sort  (Divide & Conquer)
  
# Theory : 

### 1. Divide & Conquer Strategy
The Divide-And-Conquer paradigm uses the following strategy to solve problems.
- Step - 1 : Break the problem into subproblems
- Step - 2 : Solve the subproblems (recursively)
- Step - 3 : Combine results of the subproblems

### 2. Merge Sort Algorithm

# Program : 
// Attach the Program written in Java
- Task - 1 : Write a simple Java program to perform sorting and check the correctness of the code.
- Task - 2 : Randomize the code to accept the input size from the user and invoke random function to generate numbers in the array.
- Task - 3 : Track the #Comparisons, #Swaps and also use time function in Java to measure the time taken for sorting
- Task - 4 : Generate the following table for Analysis
  
| Input size, N | #Comparisons | #Swaps  | Time taken (ns) |
| :-------------:| :--------: | :--------------:  | :----------: |
| 10             |    |   |  |  |
| 100             |    |   |  |  |
| 1000             |    |   |  |  |
| 10000             |    |   |  |  |
| 100000             |    |   |  |  |
| 100000             |    |   |  |  |

- Task - 5 : Plot the graph with N on the X-axis and T(n) on the Y-axis

# Conclusion : 
* Understood the concept of Divide and Conquer Strategy upon Merge Sort
* Was able to compute the Time Complexity of both the Sorting techniques based on Frequency Count Method
* Implemented and tested the complexity of the Merge Sort
