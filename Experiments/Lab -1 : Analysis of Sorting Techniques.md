# Selection Sort

## Step 0: Consider the Initial Array, arr[] = {17, 34, 25, 49, 09} 
The entire array is currently unsorted. The sorted portion is empty.

## Step 1: 1st Iteration
Find the smallest element in the entire array and swap it with the first position.

| i | j | minindex | arr[] | Comparison (arr[i] vs arr[j]) | Swap?| Updated Array |
| - | - | -------- | ----- | ----------------------------- | ---- | ------------- |
| 0 |	1 |	0	| [17, 34, 25, 49, 9]	| 17 < 34 |	No |	[17, 34, 25, 49, 9] |
| 0	| 2	| 0	| [17, 34, 25, 49, 9]	| 17 < 25	| No | [17, 34, 25, 49, 9] |
| 0	| 3 | 0 |	[17, 34, 25, 49, 9]	| 17 < 49	| No | [17, 34, 25, 49, 9] |
| 0	| 4	| 4 |	[17, 34, 25, 49, 9]	| 17 > 9	| Yes	| [9, 34, 25, 49, 17] |

arr[] = {09, 34, 25, 49, 17}
The first element, 09 is now in its correct position, and the array is divided into a sorted portion {09} and an unsorted portion {34, 25, 49, 17}.

## Step 2: 2nd Iteration
Find the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion {34, 25, 49, 17} and swap it with the second position.

| i | j | minindex | arr[] | Comparison (arr[i] vs arr[j]) | Swap?	| Updated Array |
| - | - | -------- | ----- | ----------------------------- | ---- | ------------- |
| 1 |	2 |	1 |	[9, 34, 25, 49, 17]	| 34 > 25 |	No |	[9, 34, 25, 49, 17] |
| 1	| 3	| 1	| [9, 34, 25, 49, 17]	| 34 < 49	| No | [9, 34, 25, 49, 17] |
| 1	| 4 |	4	| [9, 34, 25, 49, 17]	| 34 > 17	| Yes	| [9, 17, 25, 49, 34] |
arr[] = {09, 17, 25, 49, 34}
Here, sorted portion is {09,17} and unsorted portion is {25,49,34}

## Step 3: 3rd Iteration
Find the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion {25, 49, 34} and swap it with the third position.

| i | j | minindex | arr[] | Comparison (arr[i] vs arr[j]) | Swap?	| Updated Array |
| - | - | -------- | ----- | ----------------------------- | ---- | ------------- |
| 2	| 3	| 2 |	[9, 17, 25, 49, 34]	| 25 < 49	| No |	[9, 17, 25, 49, 34] |
| 2	| 4	| 2	| [9, 17, 25, 49, 34]	| 25 < 34	| No |	[9, 17, 25, 49, 34] |
At the end of this iteration, element 25 is already in its correct position.

arr[] = {09, 17, 25, 49, 34}
Here, sorted portion is {09,17,25} and unsorted portion is {49,34}

## Step 4: 4th Iteration
Find the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion {49, 34} and swap it with the fourth position.

| i | j | minindex | arr[] | Comparison (arr[i] vs arr[j]) | Swap?	| Updated Array |
| - | - | -------- | ----- | ----------------------------- | ---- | ------------- |
| 3	| 4	| 3	| [9, 17, 25, 49, 34]	| 49 > 34	| Yes |	[9, 17, 25, 34, 49] |

Now, after the 4th iteration, only one element remains 49, which is inherently in its correct place as itâ€™s the last and largest element in the list.

So, at the end of the 4th iteration, the entire array is sorted in ascending order:

arr[] = {09, 17, 25, 34, 49}
That completes the selection sort for the given array
